## ✅ What Was Updated in README.md

### 1. Title and Header
**Before**: Generic title about computer vision
**After**: 
```markdown
# Markerless Motion Capture for Lower Limb Musculoskeletal Analysis
**Development and Validation of Ground Reaction Force Estimation**
```

### 2. Badges
Added:
- University of Queensland badge
- Bachelor of Engineering degree badge
- Completion date: July 2025

### 3. Overview Section
Updated to reflect:
- Bachelor's thesis (not Master's)
- Completed at UQ in July 2025
- 98% cost reduction ($2,000 vs $100,000+)
- Commercial-grade cameras (not "sub-optimal")

### 4. Key Achievements
Replaced generic metrics with **actual thesis results**:
- R² = 0.890 (95% CI: 0.878-0.902) for vertical GRF
- Joint angle RMSE: 3.54° ± 1.02°
- Hungarian algorithm: 100% success, 35.95 mm accuracy
- 28% triangulation improvement
- 81s processing time
- External validation results

### 5. Results Summary Table
Updated with precise metrics from your thesis:
- Vertical GRF R²: 0.890 (exceeds 0.85 threshold)
- Joint angles: 3.54° ± 1.02° (meets < 5° criterion)
- Processing speed: 81s for 60s trial
- Equipment cost: < $2,000 (98% reduction)
- External validation: 1057.88 N (range: 1000-1112 N)

### 6. Technical Innovations Section (NEW)
Added comprehensive section with 4 key contributions:
1. **Biomechanically-Informed Triangulation** (28% improvement)
2. **Hungarian Algorithm for Optimal Assignment** (100% success)
3. **Physics-Based Force Estimation** (validated approach)
4. **Clinical Validation Framework** (exceeds thresholds)

### 7. Citation
